  "description": "Honestly the greatest lotion I have ever used. The smell is one thing, I literally want to eat it, but the way I feel after using it is just amazing. I have always struggled with eczema all over my body. No matter what time of year it is, my skin is insanely dry. I have been through every lotion Walmart and target have to offer. After one week, I noticed a difference in my entire body. ",

  "description": "I have very dry skin on legs, hands, arms. I use lotion twice per day and when I take off my socks or yoga pants white flakey skin comes off my legs. I have tried vasline products, even vasline with cocoa butter. Greasy. Burts bee wax, eucerin,Aquaphor, nothing. I was hesitent about trying this but when I saw the reviews for people getting great .

  "description": "I accidentally purchased two bottles of this and am glad I did. I've already used up one since last October. The lotion has a light scent that smells great and fades away within an hour. The scent meshes well with my natural body smell. It's good for moisturizing normal skin and leaves it with a soft feeling, not greasy, but a bit sticky.would repurchase hopefully  ",
